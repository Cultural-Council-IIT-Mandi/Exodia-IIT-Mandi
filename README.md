## Basic rules to write code

- Jo bhi tum kro as summary zDesignStructure me daalte jana sahi format me jaise maine daala hai, date ke sath.
- Try krarna components jyada bnao, taaki maximum chije structured + reusable ho.
- Components ke naam thode ase rakhna - like eg gallery page ke liye xyz component bana rha hu toh Gallery_xyz.tsx.
- zPageUpdate file isiliye bnae hai, like tumne kahi pr koi new font, koi new package, ya worst case me kisi existing package ka version change kiya ho toh asie chije apne page ke aage isme likh dena niche.
- Public me sara photo, video, icons, etc rakhna.
- lib --> since apan ko like kuch events, kuch photos, etc dikhane hai toh vo sab ko exclusively database me rakhne ki need nhi hi kyokii vo kuch hi hai limited in number so unko lib folder ke andar rakhna hai.
- types --> we are using TypeScript, so har file me type type used krne honge, to vo types sare is file me define honge. Try krna ek page ke types ek sath ho.
